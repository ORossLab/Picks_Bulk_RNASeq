# Code and resources relating to our manuscript "Characterizing the expression profile of 3R tau pathology in Pickâ€™s disease"

## Short-read bulk RNA Sequencing https://github.com/ORossLab/Picks_Bulk_RNASeq/blob/main/README.md

The script used for data clean up, quality control, normalization using CQN, and differential gene expression analysis can be found here in the "Bulk Short-read RNASeq Analysis Script" tab.
The script used for WGCNA can be found in the "WGCNA" tab.

## Long-read bulk RNA Sequenicng 

For long-read RNA Sequencing analysis we used scripts and resources available through the PacBio github page at:
